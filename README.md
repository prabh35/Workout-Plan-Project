# Project: Workout Plan system

## Application

**What will the app do?**

The aim of the project is to develop a workout plan system that allows user to display different workout plans, add an exercise, remove an exercise, view the workout plan, add 'SetsXRepetitions' of each exercise, and  checkmark the completed exercise.


**Who will use it?**

Anyone who is interested in physical activity and finds a use of a workout plan can use this project.


**Why is this project of interest to you?**

My mother always asked me to get the groceries from the nearby grocery store and each time I'd forget something. My need of making a grocery list and the childhood nostalgia it brings to me makes this project very interesting for me.
